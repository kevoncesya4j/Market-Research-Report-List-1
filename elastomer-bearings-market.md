<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Elastomer Bearings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Plain Bearings</li><li>Laminated Bearings</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Elastomer bearings primarily consist of two types: plain bearings and laminated bearings. Plain bearings are made of solid elastomer materials that provide excellent flexibility and load-bearing capabilities, commonly used in bridge and building applications. Laminated bearings, on the other hand, consist of layered elastomers and are often reinforced with steel plates, enhancing their capacity to withstand dynamic loads and movements. Both types serve to isolate vibrations and accommodate structural movements, making them essential in civil engineering and construction projects.</p></p>
