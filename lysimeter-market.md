<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Lysimeter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Weighing Type</li><li>Non-weighing Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The lysimeter market is primarily categorized into two types: weighing and non-weighing. Weighing lysimeters measure soil moisture by tracking changes in weight, providing precise data on water usage and evapotranspiration. These are valuable for detailed studies in agriculture and environmental monitoring. Non-weighing lysimeters, on the other hand, rely on simpler methods, usually collecting leachate for analysis without weight measurement. They are often more cost-effective, making them suitable for broader applications in less critical studies or educational purposes.</p></p>
